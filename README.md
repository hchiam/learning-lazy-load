# Learning Lazy Load

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Lazy Loading:

* Image examples: <https://css-tricks.com/the-complete-guide-to-lazy-loading-images/>
* Use dominant colour or low-fi LQIP image placeholders in `src`: <https://imagekit.io/features>
  * (Seems like a freemium service to hold your images, and to provide URLs with options to transform images. See `src/index.html` for an example. E.g.: `src="...jpeg?tr=w-400,h-300,bl-30,q-50` for width, height, blur, and quality.)
* Research later if have time (generalized example; not just images): <https://github.com/malchata/yall.js>
